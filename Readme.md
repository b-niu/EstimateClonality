# A modified package of EstimateClonality

EstimateClonality is an R package which uses read count and copy number information to temporally and clonally dissect SNVs, written by Nicholas McGranahan (nicholas.mcgranahan@cancer.org.uk).

This version fixes some issues in the original code and makes a little optimization.
